Three important concepts with Object Oriented Programming:

* encapsulation
* inheritance
* polymorphism


### Encapsulation

Use objects to organize your data.

Think about a member item like "private String firstName;"  This variable is not available outside of its class.


### Inheritance

"is-a" refers to inheritance.  Frog is-a Critter.

"has-a" refers to composition.  Frog has a color.


### Polymorphism
