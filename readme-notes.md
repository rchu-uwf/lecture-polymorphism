Three important concepts with Object Oriented Programming:

* encapsulation
* inheritance
* polymorphism


### Encapsulation

Use objects to organize your data.

Think about a member item like "private String firstName;"  This variable is not available outside of its class.


### Inheritance

"is-a" refers to inheritance.  Frog is-a Critter.

"has-a" refers to composition.  Frog has a color.


### Polymorphism



### UML

minus indicates private.

plus indicates public

italics indicates abstract

### Define a constructor


### Define a method

public static myFunction(int x)

3 + 20*2
4343

## Midterm overview

### How long to we have to take the midterm?

### General format 

    True/False.
    Multiple choice.
    "What does this code do".
    
    Three coding questions, with instructions given as a JUnit test, or as a UML diagram.
   How can I practice this?
   

### Java types

    Primitive types and their defaults.
   
    Numeric primitives: Default to zero
    short, int, long, float and double
    
    Textual Primitives: Default to \u0000
    byte and char
    
    Boolean defaults to false
    null
    
    Type coercion.
    
    double to int
    3.14 becomes 3
    

### Branching and looping

    Branching
        if/else
        switch
    Loops
        while (!isGameOver) { }
        for (int i = 0; i < zoo.length; ++i) { }
        do {something} while (condition)   //will run at least once

### Array basics

    Looping over the contents of an array.
    Initializing arrays.
    Be familiar with .length

### Object Oriented Programming principles

    What are they and what does each depend on?
    * encapsulation depends upon classes
    * inheritance depends upon encapsulation
    * polymorphism depends upon inheritance

### Miscellany

    I/O topics will not be on the exam.
    UML to code, code to UML.
    JUnit.
